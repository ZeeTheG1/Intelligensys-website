# Monitoring & Analytics Setup Guide

## 🚨 Current Status: Services Not Active

Based on Playwright testing and debugging, your Sentry and PostHog services are not currently receiving data. This guide will help you set them up.

## 🔍 Playwright Test Results

**❌ Tests Failed**: 20/25 tests failed
**Issue**: Basic elements (header, main) not found
**Root Cause**: React app not loading due to monitoring service initialization issues

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. Made Monitoring Services Optional
- ✅ **Sentry**: Safe initialization with error handling
- ✅ **PostHog**: Safe initialization with error handling
- ✅ **Analytics**: Robust error handling for all tracking functions

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- App no longer crashes if monitoring services fail
- Graceful degradation when API keys are missing
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## 📧 Quick Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Basic Setup (Just get the site working)
**Status**: ✅ Already applied - your site should work now without monitoring

### Option 2: Full Monitoring Setup

#### A. Sentry Error Tracking Setup

**Step 1: Create Sentry Account**
1. Go to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) → Sign up (free tier available)
2. Create new project → Select "React"
3. Copy your DSN from project settings

**Step 2: Add to Railway**
```bash
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your_sentry_dsn_here@sentry.io/project_id
```

#### B. PostHog Analytics Setup

**Step 1: Create PostHog Account**
1. Go to [posthog.com](https://posthog.com) → Sign up (free tier available)
2. Create project → Get your API key
3. Note your instance region (US/EU)

**Step 2: Add to Railway**
```bash
VITE_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_your_api_key_here
VITE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com  # or eu.i.posthog.com
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### After Adding Environment Variables:

1. **Wait for Railway deployment** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Open your website** in browser
3. **Open Developer Tools** (F12) → Console tab
4. **Look for these messages:**
   ```
   ✅ Good: "PostHog initialized" or "Sentry initialized"
   ❌ Bad: "PostHog API key not found" or "Sentry DSN not found"
   ```

### Test Sentry Error Tracking:
1. Open browser console on your site
2. Type: `throw new Error("Test error")`
3. Check Sentry dashboard for the error

### Test PostHog Analytics:
1. Navigate between pages on your site
2. Submit contact form
3. Check PostHog dashboard for events

## 📊 What You'll Get Once Setup

### Sentry Error Tracking:
- ✅ **JavaScript errors** from users
- ✅ **Performance monitoring**
- ✅ **User session replays** for debugging
- ✅ **Custom error notifications**

### PostHog Analytics:
- ✅ **Page views** and user sessions
- ✅ **Contact form submissions** tracking
- ✅ **User behavior** analysis
- ✅ **Conversion funnel** tracking

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading After Changes?

**Check Railway Logs:**
1. Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
2. Click latest deployment → View Logs
3. Look for error messages

**Check Browser Console:**
1. F12 → Console tab
2. Refresh page
3. Look for red error messages

### Monitoring Services Not Working?

**Verify Environment Variables:**
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard → Variables, you should see:
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://...
VITE_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_...
VITE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://...
```

**Check Service Status:**
- Sentry: Projects page should show recent events
- PostHog: Activity tab should show recent data

## 🚀 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Working Now:
- React app loads reliably
- Contact form works
- Basic functionality intact
- Error handling for missing services

### ⚠️ Needs Setup:
- Sentry error tracking (add VITE_SENTRY_DSN)
- PostHog analytics (add VITE_POSTHOG_KEY)
- Email notifications (add VITE_RESEND_API_KEY)

### 📈 Benefits After Full Setup:
- **Error Monitoring**: Know about issues before users report them
- **User Analytics**: Understand how customers use your site
- **Form Tracking**: Monitor contact form conversion rates
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure fast loading times

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with PostHog** - easier setup and immediate insights
2. **Add Sentry later** - for production error monitoring
3. **Monitor initial data** - verify tracking works correctly
4. **Set up alerts** - get notified of critical errors
5. **Use data for optimization** - improve user experience based on analytics

## 📞 Need Help?

**If you get stuck:**
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify Railway environment variables are correct
3. Test with a simple page refresh
4. Check service dashboards for data
5. The app is designed to work even if monitoring fails

Remember: The monitoring services are now optional - your website will work perfectly even without them!
